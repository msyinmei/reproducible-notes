    The C pre-processor macros `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, and `__TIMESTAMP__`
    captures the current time, and thus will obviously make a build
    unreproducible.

  description: |
    build_info.py contains several variables which need to be made deterministic, eg:
    BUILD_DATE='2014-10-08'
    BUILT_BY='pbuilder'
    BUILD_TIME='15:55'
    BUILT_ON='jenkins'
    BUILD_CPU='AMD Opteron 62xx (Gen 4 Class Opteron)'

    latest reproducible builds dpkg-dev branch causes using __DATE__/__TIME__
    to become an error (-Werror=date-time) and this is on by default
