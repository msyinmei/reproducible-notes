timestamps_from_cpp_macros:
  description: |
    The C pre-processor macros `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, and `__TIMESTAMP__`
    captures the current time, and thus will obviously make a build
    unreproducible.

timestamps_in_documentation_generated_by_doxygen:
  description: |
    If Doxyfile contains HTML_TIMESTAMP = YES, Doxygen will add a
    timestamp to its generated documentation.

timestamps_generated_by_docbook_to_man:
  description: |
    docbook-to-man adds a timestamp at the end of manpages it generates.
variables_in_build_info_py:
  description: |
    build_info.py contains several variables which need to be made deterministic, eg:
    BUILD_DATE='2014-10-08'
    BUILT_BY='pbuilder'
    BUILD_TIME='15:55'
    BUILT_ON='jenkins'
    BUILD_CPU='AMD Opteron 62xx (Gen 4 Class Opteron)'

  description: |
    latest reproducible builds dpkg-dev branch causes using __DATE__/__TIME__
    to become an error (-Werror=date-time) and this is on by default
randomness_in_minimal_required_version_for_dependencies_when_no_symbols_are_used:
  description: |
    dpkg-shlibdeps does not always output the minimum dependency when a package
    does not use any symbols.
    note that this bug has been fixed, so some packages will be fixed now.

blacklisted_on_jenkins:
  description: |
    Some packages have been blacklisted not to be tested for build reproducibility on jenkins.debian.net,
    either because their build hangs, spawns processes and doesnt kill them or because they use too much ressources.
random_ordering_of_conffiles:
  description: |
    conffiles are listed in random order in control.tar.gz.
    For packages which else build reproducible this can lead to randomly reproducible builds...
randomly_reproducible:
  description: |
    Some packages sometimes build reproducible and sometimes not.
    This can be caused by https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/issues/random_ordering_of_conffiles_issue.html
