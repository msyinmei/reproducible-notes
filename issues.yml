blacklisted_on_jenkins:

debbindiff_runs_forever:
  description: |

not_using_dh_builddeb:
  description: |
    We currently adjust the file mtimes in dh_builddeb. Packages which
    calls `dpkg --build` directly should have a prior call to:
    `BUILD_DATE := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | sed -n -e 's/^Date: //p')`
    and
    `find debian/tmp -depth -newermt '$(BUILD_DATE)' -print0 | \
         xargs -0r touch --no-dereference --date='$(BUILD_DATE)'`
    Another option is to convert the build system to `dh`.
