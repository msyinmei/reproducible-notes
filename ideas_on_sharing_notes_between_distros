This is from the Reproducible Summit in Athens.


* use cases for sharing notes
  + for upstream toolchain developers: what am i breaking
  + non toolchain upstream about what's wrong with their package
  + distro people wanting to check out the status and *history* on other distros and comparing

* we should keep it streamlined, like continue keep it in git.
* yaml seems to be cool for everybody


* issues
  + they can be fixed in different ways
  + they can be distro-specific
  + they can be implementation-specific
  + ........
* would be handy to have meta-issues

* history:
  + link to example patches and keep old issues

* linking packages between distros:
  + CPE (from CVE stuff)

* maintaining the notes:
  + we need a format where we can separate "upstream" issues, distro-specific issues, distro-specific versions, etc
  + different distros might have different way to fix issues

* moving stuff from wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/ to the notes (→ lamby)

* format:
