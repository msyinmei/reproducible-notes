Notes on build reproducibility of Debian packages
=================================================

This repository contains notes concerning the status of build
reproducibility of Deban packages.

packages.yml
------------

`packages.yml` is a YAML file with notes about source packages.

A full entry looks like the following:

    socat:
      version: 1.7.2.4-1
      issues:
        - timestamps_from_cpp_macros
      bugs:
        - 764251
      comments: |
        Patch submitted.

Every field is optional, although a version number would be useful to do
cleanups.

 - `version`: is the Debian version number of the examined source package.

 - `issues`: is a list of tags as described in the `issues.yml` file.

 - `bugs`: is a list of Debian bug numbers reported about the package.

 - `comments`: is a free-form multi-line field to leave comments.

issues.yml
----------

`issues.yml` is a YAML file with a description of common issues.

A full entry looks like the following:

    timestamps_from_cpp_macros:
      description: |
        The C pre-processor macros `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, and `__TIMESTAMP__`
        captures the current time, and thus will obviously make a build
        unreproducible.
      url: https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/TimestampFromCPPMacros

The name of the issue should contain underscores instead of hyphens as
text editor autocompletion works better with the former.

 - `description`:  is a mandatory free-form multi-line description of the issue.

 - `url`: is an optional field pointer to a page (ideally on the Debian wiki)
    describing the issue in more details.

 - `deterministic` (default False): is an optional field indicating whether
    we expect that this issue would always happen on Jenkins; i.e. if
    there is a successful build, then the issue is fixed.
